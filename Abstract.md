## ConTests: Behaviour-Driven Development in ConTeXt

This document defines the ConTests (t-contests) ConTeXt [Behavour-Driven 
Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) 
testing module.

This document uses the t-literate-progs ConTeXt module to define the 
t-contests module. This means that the code required to implement the 
ConTests module is an integral part of this document.
